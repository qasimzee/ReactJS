# ReactJS - Blogging website
Today I started my ReactJS training. The objective is to create a blogging website based on react. I will keep updating here and that will be open sourced.

The backend will more likely be wordpress and frontend will be react. 

I will expose WP DB with the APIs and will consume those APIs on the frontend to render my blog entries

To run the app: npm run dev
